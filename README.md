## 📝 Overview

This script scans a given folder, identifies the files, and organizes them into subfolders based on their extensions. If a subfolder corresponding to the file extension doesn't already exist, it creates one and moves the file there. 📁

This is ideal for cleaning up and organizing large directories with various file types. 🔧

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The script reads the contents of the specified directory. 📂
2. It checks if each item is a file. 🧐
3. For each file, it extracts the file extension. 📝
4. It then checks if a subfolder for the extension exists:
   - If it exists, the file is moved into the respective subfolder. ➡️
   - If it doesn't exist, a new folder is created, and the file is moved there. 🆕

This helps in organizing files by type, making your directory structure cleaner and easier to navigate. 🧹
